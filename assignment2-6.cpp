// Write a program that  stores the following values in five different variables: 28, 32, 37, 24, 33
// The program should first calculate the sum of these five variables and store the result in a separate variable named sum. Then, the program should divide the sum variable by 5 to get the average.
// Display the sum and average with precision 3 on the screen.
